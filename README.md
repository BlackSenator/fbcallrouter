# An extended call routing for AVM FRITZ!Box

The programm is trying to identify spam calls. So it is listen to the FRITZ!Box callmonitor and does several wash cycles to figure out whether it is spam or not.

**You need to have a separate spam telefon book beside your phonebook!
The program only works in the German telephone network!**

For an incoming call a cascaded check takes place:

* First, it is checked, whether the number is already known in one of your telephone books (`'whitelist'`).

* If not, than it is checked if it is a foreign number. If you have set (`'blockForeign'`) the number will be transferred to the corresponding phonebook (`'blacklist'`) for future rejections.

* Than it is checked if a domestic number has a valid area code (ONB*) or celluar code**. Quite often spammers using fake area codes. If so, the number will be transferred to the corresponding phonebook (`'blacklist'`) for future rejections.

* If all this passed, it is checked at [tellows](https://www.tellows.de/) if this number has received a bad score (six to ten) and at least more than three comments. You can adapt the values in the configuration file.
The second parameter is for quality purposes: not a single opinion there should block a service provider whose call you might expect.
But if the score is proven bad according to your settings, the number will be transferred to the corresponding phonebook (spam) for future rejections.

If you set `'logging'` and the `'loggingPath'` is valid, the essential process steps for verification are written to the log file `callrouter_logging.txt`. If `'loggingPath'` is empty the programm directory is default.

*ONB = OrtsNetzBereiche (Vorwahlbereiche/Vorwahlen). The list used is from the [BNetzA](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Sachgebiete/Telekommunikation/Unternehmen_Institutionen/Nummerierung/Rufnummern/ONRufnr/ON_Einteilung_ONB/ON_ONB_ONKz_ONBGrenzen_Basepage.html) and should be valid for a limited period of time. If you want to update them, then download the offered **CSV file** (Vorwahlverzeichnis). Unpack the archive (if necessary in the archive) and save the file as `ONB.csv` in the `./assets` directory.

** The [BNetzA](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Sachgebiete/Telekommunikation/Unternehmen_Institutionen/Nummerierung/Rufnummern/MobileDienste/zugeteilte%20RNB/MobileDiensteBelegteRNB_Basepage.html) provided no list for download celluar codes (RNB). Those are recently set fix as `const CELLUAR` in `callrouter.php`.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.0
* callmonitor (port 1012) is open - if not: dial `#96*5*` to open it
* Composer (follow the installation guide at https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Installation

### Programm

Install requirements are:

```console
git clone https://github.com/blacksenator/fbcallrouter.git
cd fbcallrouter
```

Install composer (see https://getcomposer.org/download/ for newer instructions):

```console
composer install --no-dev
```

Edit `config.example.php` and save as `config.php` or use an other name of your choice (but than keep in mind to use the -c option to define your renamed file)
The least essential adaptation is setting your FRITZ!Box password:

```PHP
'password'     => 'xxxxxxxxx',         // your Fritz!Box user password
```

### Preconditions on the FRITZ!Box

If you do not have your own phonebook for spam numbers, it is essential to add a new one (e.g. "Spamnummern"). Note that the first phonebook ("Telefonbuch") has the number "0" and the numbers are ascending according to the index tabs. Then you have to link this phonebook for call handling: Telefonie -> Rufbehandlung -> Neue Regel -> ankommende Rufe | Bereich: "Telefonbuch" | Telefonbuch: "Spamnummern"

The programm accessed the Fritz!Box via TR-064. Make sure that your user is granted for this interface. The proposed user `dslf_config` is the default user when logging in with a password and without user selection and has the required rights!

## Usage

### Test:

```console
php fbcallrouter run
```

If `On guard...` appears, the program is armed.

Make a function test in which you e.g. call your landline from your mobile phone: your mobile phone number **should not** end up in the spam phone book!
If the number is in your phone book, nothing should happen anyway (on whitelist).
Otherwise: it is not a foreign number, the ONB/RNB is correct and you certainly do not have a bad entry in tellows.
If you do not receive an error message, then at least all the wash cycles have been run through once.
To cancel, press CTRL+C.

### Permanent background processing:

a) edit `user=` in `fbcallrouter.service` with your device user (e.g. `pi`)  and save the file

```console
nano fbcallrouter.service
```

b) copy the file `fbcallrouter.service` into `/etc/systemd/system`

```console
sudo cp fbcallrouter.service /etc/systemd/system/fbcallrouter.service
```

c) enable the service unit:

```console
sudo systemctl enable fbcallrouter.service
```

d) check the status:

```console
sudo systemctl status fbcallrouter.service
```
