# An extended call routing for AVM FRITZ!Box

The programm is trying to identify spam calls. So it is listen to the FRITZ!Box callmonitor and does several washes!

For an incoming call a cascaded check takes place:
First, it is checked whether the number is already known in one of your telephone books (`getPhonebook`).
If not,  than it is checked if the caller used a valid area code (ONB*). Quite often spammers using fake area codes. If so the number will be transferred to the corresponding phonebook (`setPhonebook`) for future rejections.
If the area code is valid it is checked at "tellows" if this number has received a bad score (> 5) and at least more than 3 comments. The second parameter is for quality purposes: not a single opinion there should block a service provider whose call you might expect (For example, the after sales service of a product for which you are happy to provide information).
But if the score is proven bad, the number will be transferred to the corresponding phonebook (spam) for future rejections.

*ONB = OrtsNetzBereiche (Vorwahlbereiche/Vorwahlen). The list used is from the [BNetzA](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Sachgebiete/Telekommunikation/Unternehmen_Institutionen/Nummerierung/Rufnummern/ONRufnr/ON_Einteilung_ONB/ON_ONB_ONKz_ONBGrenzen_Basepage.html) and should be valid for a limited period of time. If you want to update them, then download the CSV file offered. Unpack the archive (if necessary in the archive) and save the file as ONB.csv in the `./assets` directory.

## Requirements

  * PHP >= 7.0
  * callmonitor (port 1012) is open - if not: dial `#96*5*` to open it
  * Composer (follow the installation guide at https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Installation

### Programm

Install requirements are:

    git clone https://github.com/blacksenator/fbcallrouter.git
    cd fbcallrouter

Install composer (see https://getcomposer.org/download/ for newer instructions):

    composer install

Edit `config.example.php` and save as `config.php` or use an other name of your choice (but than keep in mind to use the -c option to define your renamed file)
The least essential adaptation is setting your FRITZ!Box password:

    'password'     => 'xxxxxxxxx',         // your Fritz!Box user password

### FRITZ!Box

If you do not have your own phonebook for spam numbers, add a new one (e.g. "Spamnummern"). Note that the first phonebook ("Telefonbuch") has the number "0" and the numbers are ascending according to the index tabs. Then you have to link this phone book for call handling: Telefonie -> Rufbehandlung -> Neue Regel -> ankommende Rufe | Bereich: "Telefonbuch" | Telefonbuch: "Spamnummern"

## Usage

### Test:

    php fbcallrouter run

If "cocked and unlocked" appears, then the program is armed. To cancel, press CTRL+C.

### Permanent background processing:

a) edit `user=` in `fbcallrouter.service` and save it

b) copy the file `fbcallrouter.service` into `/etc/systemd/system`

c) enable the service unit:

    sudo systemctl enable fbcallrouter.service

d) check the status:
